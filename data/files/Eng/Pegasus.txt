Pegasus
Pegasus is spyware developed by the israelian Company "NSO Group".
The company was founded in 2010 and specializes in the development of Cyberweapons.
Their software doesn't get distributed to private persons, only to "authorized governments", as their intents are the prevention of criminal activities and terrorism.
Pegasus was first discovered in 2016 by a Lab of the Canadian University Toronto. In that time, Pegasus infected devices via spear-phishing (clicking on links in messages to install the malware).

The company was sued twice for exploiting security leaks to install Pegasus on thousands of devices. (Whatsapp/Facebook & Apple)
Pegasus is a spyware developed to collect sensible data, primarily focused on mobile devices.
Federal Constitutional Court stated that Pegasus would be unconstitutional to use with the infiltration of digital endpoints.
